Vision:
Create a global web and mobile platform where anyone, regardless of age, race, or background, can teach or learn skills in their native language. The goal is to make skill-sharing universally accessible and culturally relevant.

Core User Roles:

Teachers

Register and list skills they can teach (only in their native language)

Set their own hourly or session-based pricing

Offer live, interactive sessions (1:1 or small group)

Get paid, with a 20% platform commission applied

Learners

Sign up and search for skills by category, language, and audience type

Book lessons based on availability, skill level, and teacher reviews

Pay via integrated gateway; receive session links and reminders

Skill Categorization System:

A. By Audience:

Students (GCSE, A-Level, IB, High School, etc.)

University Students (Subject-specific help)

Working Professionals (Career-oriented skills)

General Learners (Hobbies, casual interests)

B. By Skill Type:

Academic Subjects

Programming & Tech (Python, Java, AI, DevOps)

Business & Finance (Excel, Project Mgmt, Accounting)

Creative & Design (Video Editing, Music, Art)

Communication & Soft Skills

Career Coaching (Resume, Interview prep)

Language Exchange (non-tutorial conversational)

Key Features:

Native Language Search & Matchmaking

Dynamic Pricing (Teacher sets price)

AI Chatbot Assistant for instant support (tech help, FAQ, bookings)

User Reviews and Ratings

Commission Handling: Platform retains 20% per booking

Support for Local Currencies and Timezones

Technical MVP Stack (Suggested with Cost Comparison):

Component

FlutterFlow Stack

Next.js Stack

Notes

Frontend

FlutterFlow  $30–70/mo (Pro/Team plans)

Next.js (React)  Free (Open Source)

FlutterFlow saves time but costs monthly; Next.js is dev-heavy

Backend

Firebase Functions (Free → ~$25+/mo for usage)

Node.js + Express or Django REST (Free)

Firebase is serverless/pay-as-you-go; custom backend gives control

Database

Firebase Firestore or Supabase (Free → $25+/mo)

PostgreSQL (e.g., Supabase, Railway) – $0–25/mo

Supabase is easier with FlutterFlow & Next.js both

Authentication

Firebase Auth (Free tier generous)

Auth0 (Free → $23+/mo) or Firebase Auth

Firebase is cost-effective and simple

AI Chatbot

OpenAI GPT API  $0.001–0.03/request

OpenAI GPT API  Same pricing

Cost is per usage; no infra cost unless using Dialogflow Enterprise

Payments

Stripe / Razorpay (Fee per transaction)

Stripe / Razorpay (same)

No platform-specific difference here

Hosting

FlutterFlow hosting included

Vercel/Netlify/Heroku (Free → $20+/mo)

FlutterFlow hosting is bundled; Next.js has flexible options

Dev Time / Hiring

1–2 Freelancers  ~£800–£2,000 MVP

1 Full-stack Dev  ~£1,500–£4,000 MVP

FlutterFlow MVP is faster; custom dev is higher cost but scalable

Long-term Scaling

⚠️ May need migration to Flutter/Dart manually

✅ Easy to scale/customize

Next.js is better for complex growth

Summary Recommendations:

Best for MVP: FlutterFlow + Firebase (fastest and lowest cost to launch)

Best for Scale: Next.js + Node.js/Django + Supabase (more control and flexibility)

Hybrid Option: Start with FlutterFlow for MVP → migrate to Flutter or Next.js stack when scaling

Next Steps:

Create wireframes for Teacher and Learner dashboards

Build MVP on Replit (backend + basic UI)

Collect early feedback from potential users

Iterate based on feedback

Prepare pitch for funding / incubation support
