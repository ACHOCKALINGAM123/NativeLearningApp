## 📝 Notes

### Current Limitations
- Styling is using inline styles instead of NativeWind classes (needs configuration fix)
- Missing actual database connection (needs Supabase project setup)
- No real payment processing (needs Stripe configuration)
- Placeholder AI responses (needs OpenAI integration)

### Development Recommendations
1. Set up Supabase project and configure environment variables
2. Implement remaining authentication screens
3. Focus on one user journey at a time (student or teacher)
4. Set up basic payment flow before adding advanced features
5. Implement comprehensive error handling and loading states

### Architecture Decisions Made
- Using Expo Router for navigation (file-based routing)
- Supabase for backend (auth, database, storage)
- React Query for data fetching and caching
- NativeWind for styling consistency
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modular component architecture for reusability

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Native Learning App with proper architecture, authentication, and core navigation. The next phase should focus on completing the user flows and integrating external services.
